* For those pages that contain many images, it is expected to load for a few seconds more than the other pages. (E.g. less than 5 seconds for search page, and about 10 seconds for discover page)

* We have used some dummy data for the demo.\
In the actor profile, you will see some random small photos under the section "More Images" that show a different person from the large photo which represent the actor. These photos will be replaced with the photos of the actual actor in the future, but right now we just generate some random photos for demo.
