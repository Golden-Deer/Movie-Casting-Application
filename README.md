# Getting Started with Golden Cast!!

Golden Cast is an online management system to help the casting team better manage a movie project and find the best actor candidates that fit the expectation of the casting team, which will greatly improve the efficient and the quality of the casting process. Instead of collecting thousands of paper resumes from multiple companies and organize them by hand for different roles, Golden Cast will allow the casting teams be able to view, select, and manage all the profiles from the actors online just with a computer.

* For those pages that contain many images, it is expected to load for a few seconds more than the other pages. (E.g. less than 5 seconds for search page, and about 10 seconds for discover page)

* We have used some dummy data for the demo.\
In the actor profile, you will see some random small photos under the section "More Images" that show a different person from the large photo which represent the actor. These photos will be replaced with the photos of the actual actor in the future, but right now we just generate some random photos for demo.
